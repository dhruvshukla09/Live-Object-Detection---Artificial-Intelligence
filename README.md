# Live-Object-Detection---Artificial-Intelligence
Our model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, the algorithm makes more localization errors but is less likely to predict false positives on background. The detection is done by applying 1 x 1 detection kernels on feature maps of three differentsizes at three different placesin the network. Finally, the algorithm learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms other detection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, when generalizing from natural images to other domains like artwork.
